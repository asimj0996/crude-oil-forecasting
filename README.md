The data for crude oil price forecasting is fetch from yahoo finance live api
where date range from 2000-01-01 to 2024-07-30. At first the necessary preprocessing data and
analysis of data is done in order to bring the data in right format. After that some graphical visualization 
is plotted to see the behavior of crude oil price during the time span. The data is splitted in training, testing and 
validation dataset where training data is from 2000 to 2018, validation data is from 2018 to 2022 and testing data is from 2022o 2025. 
In evaludation metrics different parameter like rmse,mse, mape and r2 square is used. After that different machine learning algorithms
is build and the performance of all the models are found out in validation and testing dataset. Lower the value of evaluation metrics
better is the performance of the model. Finally future forecasting crude oil stock price is predicted by the next 14 days.
